def process_attendance(student_data: List[Dict], confidence_threshold: float = 0.6) -> Dict:
    """
    Process attendance data for a group of students.
    
    Args:
        student_data: List of student information dictionaries
        confidence_threshold: Minimum confidence for face recognition
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing processed attendance results
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If student_data is empty or invalid
